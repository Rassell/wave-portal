# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

Another blockchain example project!

Based on buildspace tutorials!

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Deployed on vercel: https://wave-portal-psi.vercel.app/ to use it with Rinkeby testnet.
